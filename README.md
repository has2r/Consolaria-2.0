## Info

Tons of exclusive mobile & old-gen console features were removed with the release of Terraria 1.3. Consolaria brings this unique content back, reworked and rebalanced for modern Terraria.

This includes:
- **Lepus, Turkor & Ocram** - all with brand new AI, Treasure Bags, Master Mode drops & music themes
- **New & improved loot** - including weapons, armors and more
- **In-game events** - Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day & Oktoberfest
- **Heart Shrine and Jungle Sanctum** structures
- **Arch Wyvern, Vampire Miner, Shadow Mummy** and all the other removed enemies
- **Exclusive vanity items** - including the Horned God set, George's set & many others
- **A variety of ported pets**, complete with extra animations
- **[Boss Checklist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2669644269)** & **[Fargo's Mutant Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2570931073)** support
- **Holy Hand Grenade!**

Holiday content is always active by default and can be restricted to the corresponding dates using the config menu.

Also try [Heartbeataria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2958674071) for content from Chinese editions of the game: together, the mods make PC Terraria the most complete experience ever!
