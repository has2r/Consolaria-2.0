Tons of exclusive mobile & old-gen console features were removed with the release of Terraria 1.3. Consolaria brings this unique content back, reworked and rebalanced for modern Terraria.

This includes:
- Lepus, Turkor & Ocram - all with brand new AI, Treasure Bags, Master Mode drops & music themes
- New & improved loot - including weapons, armors and more
- In-game events - Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day & Oktoberfest
- Heart Shrine, Jungle Sanctum and Second Pyramid Room structures
- Arch Wyvern, Vampire Miner, Shadow Mummy and all the other removed enemies
- Exclusive vanity items - including the Horned God set, George's set & many others
- A variety of ported pets, complete with extra animations
- Mc MoneyPants NPC
- Support for Boss Checklist, Fargo's Mutant Mod, Achievement Mod, Music Display and Munchies
- Holy Hand Grenade!

Holiday content is always active by default and can be restricted to the corresponding dates using the config menu.

Also try Heartbeataria for content from Chinese editions of the game: together, the mods make PC Terraria the most complete experience ever!
