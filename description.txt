During the development of Terraria 1.3, tons of exclusive mobile & old-gen console features got removed. Consolaria is a mod that aims to bring this unique content back - fixed, reworked & rebalanced to the level of modern Terraria.

This includes:
- Lepus, Turkor & Ocram - all with brand new AI, Treasure Bags, Master Mode drops & exclusive music themes
- New & improved vanilla+ loot - including weapons, armors, mounts & more
- Removed in-game events - including Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day & Oktoberfest
- Heart Shrine & Jungle Sanctum underground structures
- Removed enemies - including Arch Demon, Vampire Miner, Shadow Mummy & more
- Console-exclusive vanity items - including the Horned God set, George's set & more
- A bunch of console-exclusive pets - including Guinea Pig, Tiphia, Cupid & more
- Boss Checklist & Fargo's Mutant Mod support
- Legendary Holy Hand Grenade!

Holiday content is always active by default & can be restricted to the corresponding dates using the config menu.

It is highly recommended to play this mod alongside Heartbeataria, since both mods complement each other in aim to restore previously unaccessible features making the PC Terraria the most complete experience ever!
